Explanation:
{% for expense in expenses %}: This Django template tag is a loop that iterates over each expense in the expenses list, which is passed from the view.

{{ expense }}: This Django template variable displays the information about each expense.

{% csrf_token %}: This is a security feature in Django forms to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. You include it in your forms.

{{ form.as_p }}: This is a Django form rendering method that outputs each form field wrapped in a paragraph (<p>) tag.

{% url 'add_expense' %}: This Django template tag generates the URL for the 'add_expense' view. It's used as the action attribute of the form, directing the form submission to the 'add_expense' URL.
